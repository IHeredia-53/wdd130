      <h2>Client Report</h2>
      <p>
        I decided to follow a format similar to the wiki page for my own Transformers-themed website. I contacted my lead developer through email. 
        There were a few delays with communication due to the method, but the website was ultimately still completed. The developer met my expectations
        for the website. Next time however, I will be more clear with the image selection.

      <h2>Lead Developer Report</h2>
      <p>
        I formed a group chat with my junior developers. We had to wait a while until I received the wireframe from my client, sending him messages 
        as to when I would receive it, but as soon as I did receive it, I shared it immediately with my junior devs. I let them chose their child
        pages and updated the client as soon as I was notified that their work was complete. I enjoyed managing my site with GitHub.

      <h2>Junior Developer Report</h2>
      <p>
        My lead developers also formed group chats via Messages. There were no issues communicating between my lead developer and myself. I knew
        what was required of me for each website, and I believe I performed accordingly, contributing to my sites followign the 
        example that my lead developers had set for me. Thankfully, I did not run into any issues with GitHub and with uploading 
        my contributions.

      <h2>General Experience and Reflections</h2>
      <p>
        The most challenging part of this project was the CSS as the lead developer. I was responsible for forming CSS that would be sufficiently
        adequate for what the client requested. As a junior developer, I had to make minor adjustments to the already-developed CSS file for my 
        own contributions, but I did not have that privilege as the lead developer. I enjoyed working with GitHub and forming (or helping to form)
        websites. If I could do this project again differently, I would be more specific as to how I wanted my website. I'm content with how it
        turned out, but I know that I will make some of my own changes to it. This was a great introduction into how real-world projects could
        look like, and I believe I'm ready to help with more projects in the future.
